This is the code for a research project for a Forth native code
compiler done in the 1990s.  The only working target for this compiler
is MIPS.  You can find an overview and the papers about it through
<http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/projects/rafts.html>.  I don't think
the code is stable enough for building on it, but maybe you can glean
something useful from it.

This code contains a version of burg that can produce Forth output.
Use

   burg -F

to get Forth output.
